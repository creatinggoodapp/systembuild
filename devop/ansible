[USE]
- Automates app deployment
  Example: install new version of sofware on multiple host, todo: list out the IP addresses of nodes in inventory and 
- Write playbook to install the software, then run the playbook from control machine.
- Service orchestratrion
- Cloud provisioning

[ELEMENT]
- YAML file: readable configuration file -> describe all of systems are interrelated. 
  key-value format
  intendentation
  " - " begin for list of value
  "|" or ">" for multiple lines
- Playbooks: control actions on groups (host files: IP, user, connection=ssh ...
- Inventory: group (host, host)
- Control machine (server): running python
- Remote machine

[HOW]
- Connecting nodes through ssh (default) or Kerberos.
- Then, pushes small programs: ansible modules
- Ad-hoc comand
  run parallel: IE. run 12 forks: $Ansible group_acb -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 12
  file transfer:                  $Ansible group_abc copy -a "src = ./. dest = /.."
  manage packages:                $Ansible group_abc -m yum -a "name=.. state= present" (check package)
  gather facts: (for conditioning) $Ansile all -m setup
- Playbook:
--- 
   name: install and configure DB
   hosts: testServer
   become: yes

   vars: ## setting
      oracle_db_port_value : 1521
   
   tasks: ## commands
   -name: Install the Oracle DB # help text 
      yum: <code to install the DB>
    
   -name: Ensure the installed service is enabled and running
   service:
      name: <your service name> # help text
